# Self-attention-using-PyTorch
Self-attention, often referred to as scaled dot-product attention, is a mechanism that allows a model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input data when processing each element. Itâ€™s a crucial component in transformer models, enabling them to capture dependencies regardless of their distance in the input sequence. This ability makes self-attention particularly powerful for tasks like machine translation, text generation, and more.
